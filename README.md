# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Health-Insurance-Claims

# Introduction
This dataset provides useful details about insurance claims, allowing us to examine demographic trends among claimants in greater detail. Age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes status, children, smoking history, and location are all included in the dataset. We may learn more about who is likely to file an insurance claim by comparing these critical criteria across regions and demographic categories like age and gender. With this knowledge in hand, we can make educated decisions when we evaluate prospective clients for our services.


# conclusion

This research utilised a dataset that contained 1340 observations and 11 different variables, all of which were taken from a health insurance claim.
The dataset was cleaned up, and some columns were taken out because they were not required for the study. The mean and mode were used to fill in the blanks in the age and regions.
We were able to gain a number of insights through the use of visualisations, such as the count of various variables, the relationships between variables, the correlation between numerical variables, and also the utilisation of the swarmplot in order to check the density of claims in terms of regions and smokers.
